Hey, Dude you need to find where we can call EventRender3D.

we need it for lot of stuff.

for example StorageEsp and waypoints and esp and tracers all use it but i have not called it yet just find where you call your method for drawing chestesp and call the render3d event there here is how you call it

EventRender3D event = new EventRender3D(partialTicks)
TeamBattleClient.getEventManager().call(event);


partialTicks was in optifine src and since this doesnt use optifine it may be renamed.
